Had an amazing stay at Abike Ade's Court Hostel! The hostel was clean, comfortable, and perfectly located – it truly felt like a second home. The top-notch facilities exceeded my expectations, and the atmosphere had the perfect blend of social vibes and quiet spaces – I loved it! You're definitely getting value for the price you pay. Highly recommended!"

Staying at Abike Ade's court hostel is one of the best decision I made, it is a home away from home equipped with all the essentials students need both for their academics as well as leisure activities.
Its location is at a place quite comfortable to access schools and other places of interest, neat is an understatement to qualify Abike Ade's court hostel, it's environment is sparkling clean with a well furnished common room for the occupants to spend quality time with themselves enhancing good friendship and relationship among them.
As a student you'll be missing a lot if you didn't stay at Abike Ade's court hostel because having a super friendly landlord is a big plus
Hurry and get at a room at this hostel and make memories while enjoying your stay there.
